### AMIV App - Android
This is the centralised amiv app for the android platform. 
The idea is to have an app which contains all social things like events etc and to provide a platform for creating micro-apps, for example a barcode generator to use as a legi.

## To Start Developing
1. Install Android Studio, if android studio asks you to install extra stuff once opened, install it.
    Gradle, the build system, will have to build first before you can edit properly.
2. 
## To add your own micro-app
1. Install Android Studio and get set up. Not so easy as it sounds.
2. Create a java package under java/ch/amiv/android_app for your own java code
3. Name your resource files with a suitable prefix to keep the folders organised, especially the layout folder.
