### AMIV App - Android
This is the centralised amiv app for the android platform. 
The idea is to have an app which contains all social things like events etc and to provide a platform for creating micro-apps which the amiv can use, for example a barcode generator to use as a legi.

## To add your own micro-app
1. Install Android Studio and get set up. Not so easy as it sounds.
2. Create a java package under java/ch/amiv/android_app for your own java code
3. Name your resource files with a suitable prefix to keep the folders organised, especially the layout folder.
4. to be continued...
